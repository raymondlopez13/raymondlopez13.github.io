                Hello Iâ€™m Raymond, a full stack web developer with a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Texas at Austin. I love to build beautiful websites using MERN, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I have great time management skills and thrive in high stress situations. I can excel in a leadership role, or as a teammate because of my ability to communicate the team goals and best ways to achieve them. I would love to work for a company that is looking to help people build their dream website for their business, portfolio, or anything else that they need!
